# Backend App Build Setup

Firstly clone or download repo and install all npm dependencies with:
``` bash
npm install
```

Now serve the app with hot reload at `localhost:3000` with:
``` bash
npm start
```

If you want to change the port open `server.js` and change PORT variable value and then do the same on frontend app proxy settings so that all API requests are redirected to new port.
